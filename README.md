# 🔐 IntegrityGuard v2 - File Integrity Checker GUI

A sleek and lightweight desktop application built with **CustomTkinter**, designed to verify the integrity of files in any selected folder. This tool computes and saves SHA-256 hashes for all files in a folder and then compares them later to detect any **modifications, deletions, or new files**.
